This is a tutorial for using self-compiled builds of the PolarSSL-library for iOS. 
PolarSSL is a light-weight open source cryptographic and SSL/TLS library written in C.
You can build apps with XCode and the official SDK from Apple with this. 
I also made a small example-app for using the libraries with XCode and the iPhone/iPhone-Simulator. 
You can also download the precompiled PolarSSL-library (0.14.3).

Enjoy PolarSSL on the iPhone!

I have made an iOS 4.3 XCode Project with PolarSSL 0.14.3 Library. The examples uses the MD5-algorithm to calculate an md5 from an UITextfield.
